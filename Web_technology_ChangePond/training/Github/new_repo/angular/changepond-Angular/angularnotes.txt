*how to display individual component view or output.
-copy component selector name form its ts file and write selector name as tag where you want.


*Databinding: access data from one file to another in same component
1. interpolation {{}} : ts => html 
2. property Binding []: ts => html (here we set attribute value)
3. event Binding ()   : html => ts (here we call event)
4. Two-way data Binding [()]: ts <=> html 
 -to perform Two-way Databinding we use ngModel directory, but ngModel directory is not part of core angular
 it is part of Forms modules ,so first we have to import Formsmodule in uour root module (app.module.ts).
 then and only then we can use ngModel directory.
